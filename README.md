# spring-boot-microservices-new

The project involves creating a microservices architecture for a product service and notification service using Java. Asynchronous communication between the services will be implemented using Kafka and RabbitMQ. A logstash pipeline will collect and store logs, a Zipkin tracing system will trace requests, and a Kibana dashboard will visualize logs and traces.
